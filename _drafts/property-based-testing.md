### Comprehensive guide

> Unlike traditional testing, which focuses on specific examples, PBT uses generalized properties to define expected behaviors, enabling the discovery of edge cases and unexpected issues.

> Example-based tests hinge on a single scenario. Property-based tests get to the root of software behavior across multiple parameters.

> We often treat our tests as specifications, but in reality they are stories.

> Shrinking, in particular, is one of the big benefits of using property-based testing libraries over fixture libraries with random generation.

To recap, adopting property-based testing will:
- Bridge the gap between what we claim to be testing and what weâ€™re actually testing.
- Reveal the assumptions that we made during testing and development, and check if they are violated.
- Expose subtle inconsistencies in our code that would be hard to detect with example-based testing.

- AI summary
	- Property-based testing removes extraneous details, making tests cleaner and more robust by allowing unimportant details to vary.
	- Traditional example-based tests make stronger claims than they can demonstrate, while property-based tests express exact circumstances for expected passes. (AI summ)
	- Property-based testing focuses on generalizing scenarios to better specify software behavior and uncover bugs missed by traditional example-based testing.
