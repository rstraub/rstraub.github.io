# Thoughtsmithing

**Core question: how do I mature thoughts into a fully formed idea?**


In the wake of the space I created to think for myself I suddenly realized: I had no clue how to mature ideas. I refer to the significant ones here, the ones where you have to delve deep. So I sat and thought about how I can make my thoughts take shape, going from random strands to concrete results.

Substantial ideas can only be formed out of enough raw material.   This might mean disparate thoughts. They often are non-linear, appear over a period of time instead of all at once and cannot be forced to come up. If we want to take our thoughts further we should therefore capture these somewhere, such as in a commonplace book. By recording them we can let the raw material pile up, and use it for further refinement. 

This phase reminds me of gold prospectors in the late 19th century. They would pan water for hours on end, hoping to find gold nuggets. This is like my thoughts: a stream of consciousness flowing like an unstoppable river, and every once in a while a golden nugget comes along. We just have to be at the ready with our sieve to pluck it out and store it.

If we have enough raw material we can use that input to form into a whole. An effective way to do that is to write. Often ideas lingering in our heads seem absolutely clear, until we try to put it on paper. At that point we must make the idea a cohesive whole, make it linear and resolve any ambiguities. In writing we evaluate the idea and cut out the rough shape that will be used to produce the final result.

This phase can be confronting. Often I’ll realize that I don’t have enough to be a compelling idea, or that it is flawed. It’s frustrating, but necessary. Unless we go through this process we will not find out whether the idea has any merit.

The last phase is where we polish the result. For me this is where I edit what I’ve written. In editing you critically evaluate the idea, trim anything that is not needed, hone it. Here you take an idea to completion putting in the final touches.
