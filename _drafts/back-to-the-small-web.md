# Back to the Small Web

Five years ago I started blogging. I’ve run a blog using Jekyll, tried Medium, Dev.to and finally settled on Substack a few years ago. Recent insights made me reconsider and come full circle, back to a static site. Why? Because of the values of the so-called Small Web.

I encountered the term small web in a series of blog posts[^smallweb], I couldn’t put it out of my head. It resonated with me. I wanted to be part of it. 

What is the small web? Quite literally the antithesis of the [big web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/). Whereas the big web is centralized and aimed at maximizing profits at the expense of its users, the small web is decentralized and all about openness and freedom. But there’s more to it than that.

## Simplicity and Minimalism

As Ben Hoyt mentions in his essay “[The Small Web is Beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)”, the small web differentiates itself with its simplicity and minimalism, focussing on content. Many sites on the small web are built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript kept to a minimum. This results in fast load-times, low-bandwidth usage, high accessibility and an overall pleasant reader experience. There’s even a category of people taking this to the extreme with so-called “text-only” sites, which I have to agree on with [Alban Brooke](https://albanbrooke.com/the-beauty-of-a-text-only-webpage/), have their own charm.

Along the way we seem to have forgotten that content is what it should be all about. Words having an impact on its readers. There are many flashy sites out there with tons of bells and whistles, but in the end it’s not the sleek design that makes readers come back to a site, it’s the content. I can think of no better way this has been said than in this hilarious [piece of satire](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com)[^fckingsite].

I made the same mistake. Five years ago, when I launched my blog  I focused a lot on aesthetics, and wanted my blog to look good. Looking good to me meant lots of colors, images, emoji’s—all of it. I probably spent more time on tweaking how my blog looked than I did writing the actual content.

Visiting these sorts of sites all that *fancy stuff* distracts me. Anything getting in the way of me understanding the author’s point should be removed, which I tend to do with *[Reader Mode](https://sigmaos.com/tips/glossary/browser-terms-explained-reading-mode)* in my browser. In this [funny post](https://herman.bearblog.dev/motherfucking-blog/) Herman Martinus says Reader mode can be seen as a testimony to how horrible the modern web has become for written content, which might be the sad truth.

Moving back to a static site gives me the control to bring my blog back to the essentials: my words.

## Own It

Having a blog on a big-web platform like Substack or Medium is trivial, but you *never* own it. The content might be yours, but the platform is theirs. Their platform, their rules. Even if you like the platform now, you might not like it’s course in the future. 

For instance, Medium has put up increasingly more paywalls over the years as well as put articles behind login walls. What if you want your content to be available to everyone? Or what if, like on Substack, there are these constant newsletter pop-ups or banners to download the app. 

You have to abide the platform’s rules. With any platform you’re in the passenger seat regarding where the platform goes, and you might not like where it goes.

As Aral Balkan says in his [post](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/) on the small web:

> On the Big Web, you never own your own home. You must rent your home from Megacorps. Most often, you don’t have to pay for your home using money. You pay for it by forfeiting your privacy, freedom of speech, and your other human rights. Collectively, we pay for it by forfeiting a democratic future.

And no, not all platforms are bad. For instance, a platform such as [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) has a much more humanistic set of values and gets my endorsement.

Furthermore, these big platforms enable those without the knowhow or need[^need-to-own] to own their blog to still share their genuine thoughts with the world. And that in itself is worth a lot.

As for me, I want to own what I write. I want to decide what I can or cannot do with my content AND my site.

## DIY

Big tech platforms have an alluring proposition: they make things convenient. They make it trivial to publish content. You deliver the content, they take care of the technical stuff.

And this works. You don’t have to worry about optimizing your site, for instance for SEO, performance[^performance] or security. You don’t have to painstakingly create a design that works well on mobile and desktop, or handle any upgrades. In all honesty that’s why I ditched my initial setup in the first place.

Convenient as this may be, it robs you of the opportunity to *do things yourself.* There’s a lot of fun to be had in a bit of DIY. Knowing exactly how your site works, building things just the way you like them, and learning a ton along the way. Doing it yourself makes it yours. You can take pride in it. If you’ve got the time and skill, tinkering with something that’s your own can be incredibly satisfying.

Despite not having as much time as I used to for tinkering on my site—having two kids will do that—I still enjoy it every once in a while. Right now I’m rolling with a stock Jekyll theme, but I intend to tinker with it or build something from scratch. The Small Web, perhaps because of its simplicity, makes it way more fun to play around with.

## Privacy

==startedit==

In his essay “[Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/)”, Parimal Satyal explains how the web has progressed technically, but declined morally — it’s lost its humanity. To wring every dollar out of it’s users, many big web sites engage in what is referred to as [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism)[^surveillance capitalism]. 

In surveillance capitalism the user’s data is the commodity. As the saying goes: *if something is free, you’re the product[^free]*.

Advertisers pay a lot of money for incredibly accurate users profiles, which is how much of the big web makes its money. To build those profiles, they need data points, tons of them. In order to get them, these platforms engage in surveillance and track your every move. Through trackers, scripts, cookies, your activity online is recorded in incredible detail, feeding the hungry algorithms.

I choose not to participate in this creepy part of the web. Taking control back into my own hands allows me to choose privacy-friendly (and open-source) alternatives for my needs[^privacyalts], or even better, get rid of things altogether. In the end it’s about  respect. Respect for the humans reading what I write[^robots].

## Summary

When I initially drafted this essay I had no idea what it was about the Small Web that lighted a fire in me. During writing, as writing does, I realized what it was: I align with its values. It’s humanity, openness and good intentions. 

That’s why I decided to be a part of it with this blog. Despite my blog being only a speck of dust in the grand universe that is the internet, it’s still a one that changed for the better. Here’s to a resurgence of the small web.

[^smallweb]: The rabbit hole opened for me at [Kagi’s Small Web project](https://kagi.com/smallweb), and it’s accompanying [blog post](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web). I’ve been reading a ton of small web posts via Kagi Small Web ever since, and wholeheartedly recommend it. Speaking of which, I’ve also been using the [Kagi Search Engine](https://kagi.com) for a few months now and have loved it from the start. Be sure to check it out!

[^fckingsite]: If you’ve ever done any web development this will crack you up, I sure had a laugh. In all seriousness though, the piece has a point, we’ve made the web hard ourselves.

[^performance]: Although, as we’ve seen, you could argue the complexity of optimizing web performance is a position we’ve gotten ourselves into in the first place.

[^need-to-own]: Yes, I realize I’m weird like that. Though if you’ve read this far I reckon you might be a little too.

[^surveillance capitalism]: A great book on the topic, and more specifically how the internet age impacts how we engage, it’s effect on truth and even democracy itself is [Byung-Chul Han’s Infocracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60659995-infocracy).

[^free]: This is obviously not always the case. Open-source software is a great example.

[^privacyalts]: For instance instead of Google Analytics, I now use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com), a privacy-friendly alternative for basic site analytics. Just like GoatCounter’s Author Martin Tournoij mentions in [this post](https://www.arp242.net/personal-analytics.html), I’m also not interested in vanity metrics, but I do want to have some sense of my readership.

[^robots]: Only slightly related, but I resonate a lot with Soophie Koonin’s post “[This website is for humans](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-website-is-for-humans/)” where she explains that AI is increasingly used to read content and serve it up (or gobble it up and regurgitate whatever it makes of it) to humans, instead of humans visiting the sites themselves. I too write to touch the heart of others, not some emotionless LLM utilized for profit.
