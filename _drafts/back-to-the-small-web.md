# Back to the Small Web

After encountering the term small web in a series of blog posts[^smallweb], I couldn’t put it out of my head. It resonated with me. I wanted to be part of it. That’s why I decided to stop posting on Substack, and moved to a solution in line with the values of the small web.

The small web is best described as the antithesis of the [big web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/). Whereas the big web is centralized, controlled by Big Tech, and aimed at maximizing profits at the expense of it’s users, the small web is decentralized and about openness and freedom.

## Simplicity and Minimalism

As Ben Hoyt mentions in his essay “[The Small Web is Beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)”, the small web also differentiates itself with its simplicity, minimalism and user-focus. Many sites on the small web are built with plain HTML, CSS and hardly any JavaScript, resulting in fast load-times, low-bandwidth usage, simplicity and a relentless focus on content. 

The content is what it should be all about — a novel insight shared with the rest of the internet. In the end, it’s not going to be the sleek design that makes readers come back to a site, it’s content will.

When I launched my blog almost five years ago I focused on its aesthetics, with tons of CSS, images and other bells and whistles. Back then I spent so much time on making it look good, rather than focusing on the content creation itself.

Nowadays, when I read content on the internet, I find these bells and whistles distracting. Above all I’m interested in what someone has to say, the core message, anything that doesn’t directly serve that purpose simply gets in the way. More often than not I will just activate *[Reader Mode](https://sigmaos.com/tips/glossary/browser-terms-explained-reading-mode)* in my browser to get rid of anything not related to the core content[^reader].

## Own It

Launching a blog on a big-web platform like Substack or Medium is trivial, but you *never* own it. The content might be yours, but the platform is theirs. Their platform, their rules. 

The platform might change direction over time. ==improve== For instance, Medium has put up increasingly more paywalls over the years as well as put articles behind login walls. The point is, you’re in the passengers seat regarding where the platform goes, and you might not like where it goes.

As Aral Balkan says in his [post](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/) on the small web:

> On the Big Web, you never own your own home. You must rent your home from Megacorps. Most often, you don’t have to pay for your home using money. You pay for it by forfeiting your privacy, freedom of speech, and your other human rights. Collectively, we pay for it by forfeiting a democratic future.

==I want to own what I write. I want to decide what I can or cannot do with my content. The Big Web is at odds with that.==

## DIY

Big tech platforms have an alluring proposition: they make things convenient. They promise, and usually deliver, in making it trivial to publish content. You deliver the content, they take care of the technical stuff.

Convenient as this may be, it has a downside. ==DIY-ing your == there’s a lot of fun to be had in a bit of DIY. There’s a charm in knowing exactly how your site works, in building things just the way you like them. Doing it by hand is even better. That way you truly own it, know it front to back, you can take pride in it. If you’ve got the time and skill, tinkering with something that’s your own can be a ton of fun. Not to mention you can learn a great deal in the process.

No, it probably won’t be as optimized, slick or easy as the big web platforms make it, but it will be yours. ~~Building it yourself has the potential to add character, to make it be distinct. Turn it into your personal corner of the internet, however quirky it may look, it will be yours.~~ 

==en wat doe ik?==

## Privacy

In his essay “[Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/)”, Parimal Satyal explains how the web has progressed technically, but declined morally — it’s lost its humanity. ==expand with original goal== To wring every dollar out of it’s users, many big web sites engage in what is referred to as [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism)[^surveillance capitalism]. 

In surveillance capitalism the user’s data is the commodity. As the saying goes: *if something is free, you’re the product[^free]*.

==this is a specific example, what about medium etc==
Advertisers pay a lot of money for incredibly accurate users profiles, which is how much of the big web makes its money. To build those profiles, they need data points, tons of them. In order to get them, these platforms engage in surveillance and track your every move. Through trackers, scripts, cookies, your activity online is recorded in incredible detail, feeding the hungry algorithms.

I choose not to participate in this creepy part of the web. Taking control back into my own hands allows me to choose privacy-friendly (and open-source) alternatives for my needs[^privacyalts], or even better, get rid of things altogether. In the end it’s about  respect. Respect for the humans reading what I write[^robots].

## Summary

Whilst writing this essay I realized what it was about the small web that spoke to me: I align with its values. It’s humanity, openness and good intentions. That’s why I decided to be a part of it with this blog. Despite it being only a speck of dust in the grand scheme of the internet, it’s one still a tiny part that changed for the better. Here’s to a resurgence of the small web.

[^smallweb]: The rabbit hole opened for me at [Kagi’s Small Web project](https://kagi.com/smallweb), and it’s accompanying [blog post](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web). I’ve been reading a ton of small web posts via Kagi Small Web ever since, and wholeheartedly recommend it. Speaking of which, I’ve also been using the [Kagi Search Engine](https://kagi.com) for a few months now and have loved it from the start. Be sure to check it out!

[^surveillance capitalism]: A great book on the topic, and more specifically how the internet age impacts how we engage, it’s effect on truth and even democracy itself is [Byung-Chul Han’s Infocracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60659995-infocracy).

[^free]: This is obviously not always the case. Open-source software is a great example.

[^privacyalts]: For instance instead of Google Analytics, I now use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com), a privacy-friendly alternative for basic site analytics. Just like GoatCounter’s Author Martin Tournoij mentions in [this post](https://www.arp242.net/personal-analytics.html), I’m also not interested in vanity metrics, but I do want to have some sense of my readership.

[^robots]: Only slightly related, but I resonate a lot with Soophie Koonin’s post “[This website is for humans](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-website-is-for-humans/)” where she explains that AI is increasingly used to read content and serve it up (or gobble it up and regurgitate whatever it makes of it) to humans, instead of humans visiting the sites themselves. I too write to touch the heart of others, not some emotionless LLM utilized for profit.
