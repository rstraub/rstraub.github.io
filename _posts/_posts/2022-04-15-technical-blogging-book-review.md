Are you thinking about starting a technical blog? Technical Blogging might be the book for you. Learn why in this review.

## üìú Technical Blogging in a Nutshell

[Technical Blogging: Amplify Your Influence](https://pragprog.com/titles/actb2/technical-blogging-second-edition/) is best described as a one-stop-shop for all everything you need to know to get your blog started. 

It covers lots of topics, and loosely follows the chronological order of planning, building, promoting, benefiting from, and scaling your blog. It aims to provide you, an aspiring blogger, an A-Z on setting up, maintaining, and growing your blog. The end goal is to increase your influence as a professional or company via your blog.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Likes and Dislikes

Technical Blogging is a good book and an enjoyable read. It's **well-structured**, and brimming with **pragmatic tips** to improve your existing blog or get a running start with a new one.

I liked the enormous **breadth of topics** covered. They range from registering a domain name, writing great content, to leveraging social media to grow your audience. After reading, you will know at least the basics of a ton of aspects of blogging.

This broad range of subjects means that the book only scratches the surface of many topics. If you are looking for in-depth content about specific subjects, you will not find it here.

Another aspect where the book could be better would be to include data from other blogs and opinions other the authors. This would have made some arguments and claims in the book more compelling.

## üôã Who Should Read It?

Starting, or aspiring technical bloggers will get the most out of Technical Blogging. It is also suited to companies who want to start a blog to grow their influence.

Are you a veteran blogger? Then this book might not be worth your while as it is at an introductory to intermediate level.

## ‚≠ê The Verdict

Are you a starting technical blogger, or thinking about becoming one? Pick up this book, it will not let you down.

It's a pleasant read, covers a lot of ground and as a starting blogger, I've found it incredibly helpful.

Final score: 7 out of 10.
