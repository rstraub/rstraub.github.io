This post will be different: no technical stuff, no code, none of that. It will be a bit personal, making it kind of scary for me.  

Let me explain.

## A Long Time Ago...

I started this blog just over two years ago. Time flies, right? Back then, I had [humble intentions](https://www.codecraftr.nl/hello-blog/): simply having a place where I could share my thoughts with the world. Not long after, I got curious. How could I improve at this blogging thing?

As those that know me will attest, I dove in with unbridled enthusiasm, verging on obsessive. I read, I learned, and I experimented. And so the blog improved. People started reading it. I was getting more reactions. Great right?

## Waning Passion

The truth is, it was great... for a while. But not long after, I lost my appetite for writing. My drive, my passion, was gone. Gone were the days when I couldn't wait to have some spare time so I could grab my trusty keyboard and start writing. 

I was concerned with optimizing content for search engines, following best practices regarding content length, post structure, writing headlines, how to get people to comment and subscribe to my newsletter, increasing audience, all that stuff. It stifled all enjoyment I found in the act of writing. It made me feel constrained, almost like I put myself in a straight jacket.

## A Reality Check

If you've stuck around for a while, you might have noticed that I haven't written anything lately. Recent developments in my personal life, becoming a father chief among them,  forced me to get my priorities straight, to only expend my time and energy on activities I genuinely cherish. Blogging, at that time, wasn't one of them.

## Authentic Exploration

My blog's tagline is *Exploring The Art of Coding*, but it is bigger than that, at least for me. It's a place where I explore, period. I've learned that I can find deep enjoyment in the act of writing. I've also learned that only happens when I write authentically. When I can be me.

That's exactly what I intend to do. Some people might like it. Others will not. Future posts might be different than what I've done so far. Posts might be structured in other ways or much less. Maybe I'll write using a more colorful vocabulary, or maybe I'll explore topics that aren't directly technical. To be honest, I don't know where ~~I'll~~ we'll end up. But that's the fun of exploring, isn't it?
