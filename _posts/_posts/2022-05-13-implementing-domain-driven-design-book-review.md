Implementing Domain-Driven Design aka *The Red Book*. I held high expectations for this title, did it deliver? Find out in this review.

## üìú About The Red Book

[Implementing Domain-Driven Design by Vaughn Vernon](https://amzn.to/3RUd746), dubbed *The Red Book* by the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) community, often recommended as a valuable companion to the original blue book.

After reading it myself I agree. It has been a great help to solidify my knowledge about DDD, but more on that later.

First thing you'll notice: this book is hefty. Coming in at 538 pages (excluding a lengthy appendix), reading and grasping Implementing DDD will take a while.

The book is composed of 14 chapters, arranged sensibly as follows:
* Introduction to DDD
* Strategic Patterns
* Architecture
* Tactical Patterns
* Application Concerns

*But what sets it apart from [The Blue Book]({{site.baseUrl}}/domain-driven-design-book-review/)?*

## üìò Differences With The Blue Book

Although it touches on the same concepts from the original book, contrary to it, The Red Book introduces *Strategic Patterns* before the *Tactical Patterns*. It also delves into the concept of *Domain Events*, which weren't covered in The Blue Book.

Throughout the book, the reader follows a fictional case study, complete with supporting code samples. This helps make the abstract ideas concrete, hence the "Implementing" part of the title.

How does it all add up? Is it a valuable book to add to your collection? Let's find out.

## ‚öñÔ∏è A Great Book, But...

All things considered, I do think this book should be on your bookshelf, but it is not without its flaws.

Aspects of the book I liked were:
* **Case study & code samples** help you thoroughly understand DDD concepts.
* **Domain events & event sourcing** are covered extensively. These architectural styles are great to have in your "toolbox" and were not covered in The Blue Book.
* **Strategic over tactical patterns**. This book does a good job of prioritizing the two and emphasizes how DDD's effectiveness is crippled without properly applying both.

Things I disliked about it were:
* **Fluff** caused by the author taking his time to get to the point, as well as examples requiring a lot of explanation, distracting from the main point.
* **Code samples age**, and some examples feel outdated due to obsolete technology.
* **Concepts (mostly) identical** to The Blue Book. If you read both there will be a lot of repetition.

Implementing Domain-Driven Design is a valuable book then, but who can benefit from it most?

## üôã Should You Read It?

You should read Implementing Domain-Driven Design if:
* You're new to DDD, or
* The concepts did not sink in after reading the Blue Book.

Is this you? Look no further, Implementing Domain-Driven Design will deliver. This title is more approachable than the Domain-Driven Design book, working hard to explain the concepts in a simple, and concrete way.

The adept DDD practitioner can safely skip this title, except if the chapters on *Domain Events*, *Event Sourcing*, or case studies are of particular interest to you.

I enjoyed this book a lot. After reading the Blue Book, I had a basic understanding of the concepts but struggled with applying them in practice. This title improved my grasp of DDD considerably.

## ‚≠ê The Verdict

Implementing Domain-Driven Design, or *The Red Book*, is an amazing book for anyone interested in Domain-Driven Design. 

It has some minor flaws, but I highly recommend this book to newcomers to DDD or those who want tangible examples accompanying the abstract concepts of DDD.

*Final score: 8 out of 10.*
