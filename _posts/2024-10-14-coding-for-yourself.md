Even though I’ve been programming for almost 15 years, I recently realized that I hardly write any programs for personal goals.

In university I programmed to get my degree, feeling somewhat indifferent about it. Then, after making it my profession, I felt responsible but didn't enjoy it. Projects I worked on were large, hulking beasts of the enterprise world. Programming, to me, was something to advance someone else’s goal.

This led me to be detached, [overvaluing the art, while undervaluing the craft in code](https://rstraub.com/craft-over-art)—code had to be well written, but I was easily distracted from the end goals. I had never used programming to solve a tedious problem of my own and never approached coding as a practical means to an end.

A few months ago, however, I coded a small program to help manage home logistics regarding when we needed and arranged a babysitter. My needs were simple: a list of dates where we usually required a babysitter sent out on a two-month schedule. It took me a few hours—mostly due to my lack of Python knowledge—but I got it working. For months this script delivered tremendous value to me.

Recently, I tweaked the script some more. I noticed that every time I got replies stating who could babysit on what date I had to create calendar appointments by hand capturing the information—very tedious! This time I responded by sitting down and thinking how code could help me. I ended up writing a small Python script that converted a CSV file with dates and the name of the babysitter into an .ics file which I used to enter the appointments to my calendar in bulk. It worked beautifully!

Stepping away from the keyboard, I realized that I had taken my ability to program and applied it for my own good. And even though the program itself was nothing ground-breaking (sometimes this can even be a [good thing](https://rstraub.com/naive-solutions-sometimes-the-smartest)), it sure was to me. Coding it, I felt such a clear sense of purpose—to solve this tiny problem improving my own life even if only by a tiny bit. The experience made me see programming in a whole new way. I more deeply appreciated its limitless potential to improve the lives of people, looking at it in a broader context as a means to deliver someone tremendous value.

All too often, feedback on your code can be so far removed, your contributions such a small cog in the monstrously large machine, that it's easy to lose touch with this feeling of purpose. Perhaps I should do this more often. The experience rekindled my passion for coding and all that from a few lines of Python code. Not bad.

*What about you? What have you recently built that made you appreciate the arcane skill of building software more?*
